💳 For digital products, the most important questions are *How do I pay?* and *When do I get my code?*

This release focuses on explaining the **payment and delivery** steps more clearly so customers know exactly what to expect after they place an order.

**Highlights:**
- 💸 Clear explanation of accepted payment methods
- ⏱️ Messaging around typical delivery time for codes
- 📩 Clarification that codes are delivered digitally (e.g. on‑screen, by email or via account)
- ⚠️ Notes about double‑checking account details before redeeming
- 🧭 Micro‑copy that reassures users throughout the checkout flow

**Behind the scenes:** 🏗️  
We refined the copy around the checkout process and added small helper texts so players feel confident when completing their purchase.  
These changes reduce support requests and help build trust with new customers.
