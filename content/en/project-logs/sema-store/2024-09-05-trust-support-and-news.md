🔒 Trust and support are critical when dealing with digital codes and payments.

This update highlights Sema Store’s **support channels and news section**. Customers can clearly see how to reach the team and what new game cards or offers have just been added.

**Highlights:**
- 📞 Display of WhatsApp number and email address for support
- 📍 Address block to show the business location
- 📰 “Our News” area for new bundles, events and announcements
- 📨 Newsletter sign‑up to stay informed about new drops
- 🧭 Footer links to key pages like “My Orders”, “Packages” and “Profile”

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We consolidated support and news information in consistent blocks reused across the site (home, footer, contact).  
This helps reassure first‑time visitors and keeps regular players up to date with the latest content.
