🧩 As more games and cards are added, structure becomes essential.

This release focuses on the **product and packages structure** within Sema Store. Game cards are now organised by game title and package value so users can quickly find the right top‑up for their account.

**Highlights:**
- 🎮 Grouping products by game or platform (for example: shooter games, mobile games, PC titles)
- 💳 Packages listed by value or in‑game currency amount
- 🔍 Clear product cards with name, value and short description
- 🧭 “Packages” section accessible directly from the main navigation
- 🏷️ Space for highlighting special packages and limited‑time bundles

**Behind the scenes:** 🏗️  
We refined the data model for products so the team can easily add new games, regions or package values without design changes.  
The new structure prepares Sema Store for a much larger catalogue over time.
