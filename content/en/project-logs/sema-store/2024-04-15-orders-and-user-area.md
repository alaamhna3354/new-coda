👤 Returning customers need a clear place to see what they bought and when.

This update improves the **orders and user area** on Sema Store, making it easier for customers to log in, see their past purchases and access the codes they received.

**Highlights:**
- 🧾 “My Orders” section showing recent and past orders
- 🔑 Simple login / logout flow to access the user profile
- 🧍 Profile area with basic contact details
- 📥 Clear indication of where and how codes are delivered
- 🧭 Direct link to the user area from the header for quick access

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We aligned the front‑end components for orders and profiles with the existing backend logic, so users have one consistent place to manage their purchases.  
This also sets the stage for future features like favourite games and saved payment methods.
