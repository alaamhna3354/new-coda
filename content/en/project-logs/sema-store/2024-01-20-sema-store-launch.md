🎮 We’re excited to launch **Sema Store**, the first stop for topping up **online game cards** and digital balances.

The goal of this first release is to make it easy for players to buy game cards and codes from home and receive them digitally in just a few steps — no need to visit a physical shop.

From the homepage, visitors immediately see that Sema Store focuses on game top‑ups, with a simple flow from choosing a package to receiving the code.

**Highlights:**
- 🧭 Clear positioning as an online game card top‑up store
- 🛒 Simple flow: choose game → select package → pay → receive code
- 📱 Mobile‑friendly layout designed for fast browsing
- 📩 Display of email, WhatsApp and address for quick support
- 📰 “New” section to highlight recently added cards and offers

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We worked with the client to keep the interface as light as possible, focusing on speed and clarity for players who just want to top up and start playing.  
This launch version sets the foundation for more games, more currencies and more automation in the future.
