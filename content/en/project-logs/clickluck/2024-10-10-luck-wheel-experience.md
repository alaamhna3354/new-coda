🎡 This release is all about making the **Luck Wheel** itself feel more engaging and intuitive.

We refined how we explain the game, emphasising the moment the wheel spins and the winner is revealed. The design now gives more visual weight to the countdown and the wheel, so players clearly understand what is happening at each step.

**Highlights:**
- ⏱️ Stronger focus on the countdown leading into the spin
- 🌀 Visual emphasis on the wheel and the winning segment
- 🎯 Clear calls‑to‑action to join the next draw
- 🕹️ Games page structure ready for multiple draws and future game types
- 💬 Copy focused on fun, excitement and ease of participation

**Behind the scenes:** 🏗️  
We prepared the front‑end for future enhancements such as multiple simultaneous draws, more detailed schedules and richer animations around the wheel.  
The goal is to keep the experience simple while leaving room for growth.
