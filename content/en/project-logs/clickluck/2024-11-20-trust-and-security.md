🔐 For an online lottery‑style platform, trust is critical.

This update focuses on explaining how ClickLuck keeps things **fair, transparent and secure**. We expanded the About and trust sections to describe the random nature of the draws and the measures taken to protect transactions and user data.

**Highlights:**
- ⚖️ Messaging around equal winning chances for all valid tickets
- 🎰 Explanation of random draw behaviour in simple language
- 🔐 Emphasis on secure payment processing and data protection
- 📞 Clear pointers to support for account and payment issues
- 🙋 Content that answers “Why should I trust this platform?” directly

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We aligned the copy with the platform’s actual behaviour and technical safeguards, making sure players understand what happens when they join a draw.  
The trust blocks are designed as reusable components that can be updated in one place and reused across the site.
