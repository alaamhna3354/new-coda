🏆 Nothing builds excitement like seeing **real winners**.

In this release we enhanced the homepage and games pages with sections for recent winners and high‑level platform statistics. Visitors can quickly see that players are actively joining draws and winning prizes.

**Highlights:**
- 🏅 Recent winners section with draw names and prize information
- 📊 High‑level statistics (number of draws, tickets sold, winners, etc.)
- 🎯 Visual focus on social proof to encourage new players to participate
- 🔁 Layout ready for live or regularly updated data
- 📈 Stronger narrative around community and ongoing activity

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We created flexible components for winners and stats that can be fed from the backend as the platform grows.  
This helps ClickLuck communicate activity and trust without manually updating static content for every draw.
