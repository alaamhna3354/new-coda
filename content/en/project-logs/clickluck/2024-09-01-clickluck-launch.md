🎉 We’re proud to launch **ClickLuck**, a modern online platform for Luck Wheel games and prize draws.

The flow is simple: players buy a ticket for a draw, wait for the countdown to finish, and then watch the wheel spin automatically to select a winner. This first release turns that idea into a smooth, accessible experience on desktop and mobile.

From the homepage, visitors can learn how the game works in a few seconds and start their journey towards the next draw.

**Highlights:**
- 🎡 Clear explanation of how the Luck Wheel works (ticket → countdown → spin → winner)
- 🪙 Simple registration and login flow for new and returning players
- 💸 Ticket purchase flow integrated into the game page
- 📱 Responsive layout designed for both mobile and desktop
- 🧭 Navigation for Home, About, Games and Contact

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We built ClickLuck on top of a robust backend to support real‑time draws and a scalable game catalogue.  
This release focuses on the core experience, while keeping the architecture ready for new game types and additional features.
