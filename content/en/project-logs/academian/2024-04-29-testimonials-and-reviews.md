⭐ Choosing an academic support service is a big decision, so this release is all about **social proof**.

We added a testimonials section where students share their experience with Academian: quality of work, communication, timing and overall satisfaction. These quotes help new visitors see that real people have successfully used the service before.

**Highlights:**
- 💬 Student testimonials focused on quality, timing and clarity
- 🧑‍🎓 Mentions of study levels and subjects to make reviews relatable
- 📌 Strong headline emphasising that clients’ words matter
- 🎯 Placement on key pages to support decision‑making moments
- 📈 Social proof blocks that can be expanded as more reviews come in

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We created a flexible testimonial component that can be reused across the site (home, services, about) so new reviews can be added without changing the layout.
