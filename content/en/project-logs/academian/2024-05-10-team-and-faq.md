👥 Trust comes not only from results, but also from the people behind the service.

This update introduces **team profiles** that highlight academic backgrounds and areas of expertise, along with an FAQ section that answers the questions students ask most often.

**Highlights:**
- 👨‍🏫 Team introductions with roles and areas of focus
- ❓ FAQ block covering deadlines, process, communication and confidentiality
- 🔒 Emphasis on privacy and originality of work
- 🧭 Better content structure on the About page
- 📞 Clear contact options for students who still have questions

**Behind the scenes:** 🏗️  
We worked with the client to collect real questions from student conversations and turned them into a reusable FAQ format.  
This helps reduce repetitive support queries and builds confidence before a student decides to place an order.
