📩 Helping students **ask for help quickly** is essential to providing good support.

In this release we focused on the quote and contact experience: simplifying the forms, clarifying the fields and making sure the Academian team receives the information they need to respond effectively.

**Highlights:**
- 📝 Streamlined quote form with key fields (degree level, deadline, type of work)
- 🧭 Clear calls‑to‑action driving visitors towards “Get a Quote” and “Contact”
- 🧾 Better structure for capturing project details from the first message
- 📈 Improved lead quality and easier follow‑up for the team
- 📱 Mobile‑friendly forms that are easy to complete on any device

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We refined the fields based on real enquiries and removed friction where possible.  
The new flow is designed to reduce back‑and‑forth emails and help students get a clear response faster.
