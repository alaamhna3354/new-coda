🎓 We’re proud to launch **Academian**, a dedicated academic support platform for students at different stages of their studies.

The goal of this first release is simple: make it easier for students to get structured, high‑quality help with assignments, dissertations, reports, presentations and more – all in one place.

From the homepage, visitors can quickly understand what Academian offers, who it’s for and how to request a quote.

**Highlights:**
- 🧑‍🎓 Clear explanation of services for Foundation, Degree, Master’s and PhD students
- 🧾 Service cards for assignments, dissertations, reports, proof‑reading, translation and CV writing
- 🧭 Simple navigation between Home, Services, About and Contact
- 📱 Responsive layout optimised for mobile and desktop
- 💬 Strong calls‑to‑action guiding users to request a quote or contact support

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We worked with the client to map out the full service offering and design a structure that can grow over time.  
The first iteration focused on clarity and trust: reassuring students that the help they receive is professional, punctual and confidential.
