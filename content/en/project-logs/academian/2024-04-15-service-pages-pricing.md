💡 In this release we focused on **clarity and transparency** around what Academian offers.

Each major service – such as assignments, dissertations, reports, translation and CV writing – now has its own dedicated section with clear descriptions, degree levels and expectations.

We also introduced a more structured pricing approach so students understand the factors that affect their quote (degree level, urgency, length and complexity).

**Highlights:**
- 📄 Dedicated descriptions for each core academic service
- 🎯 Explanations tailored to different degrees (Foundation, Degree, Master’s, PhD)
- 💳 Clearer pricing logic to set expectations before contacting the team
- 🧭 Improved on‑page navigation to help students find the right service faster
- 🧾 Better grouping of related services (editing, proofreading, formatting, etc.)

**Behind the scenes:** 🏗️  
We reorganised content so the team can easily add, remove or update services without redesigning the whole page.  
This sets the foundation for future localisation and multi‑language support if needed.
