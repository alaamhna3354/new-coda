🎓 Formación ANAPAT works through a network of **approved training entities** that deliver certified operator courses in multiple provinces.

This update enhances the way entities and courses are displayed, making it easier for users to find where and when training is available, and which organisation delivers it.

**Highlights:**
- 🧭 Listing of *Entidades Formadoras* with address, province, website and contact details citeturn8search7turn8search4turn8search5
- 📅 Course catalogue with dates, locations and codes for upcoming operator training citeturn8search2
- 🔗 Detail pages linking entities to their scheduled courses
- 🗺️ Clear geographic information (province, city, industrial estate, postcode)
- 📧 Direct access to entity websites and email for enrolment

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We standardised the way entity and course data is shown to users, preparing the ground for future filters by region, entity or date.  
The course cards and entity profiles are reusable components that can be enriched with more fields over time.
