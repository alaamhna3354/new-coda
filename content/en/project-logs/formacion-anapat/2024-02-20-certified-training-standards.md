**Highlights:**
- 📜 Prominent mention of UNE 58923 and ISO 18878 on the training section
- ✅ Explanation of what certification by AENOR means for operators and companies
- 🧑‍🏫 Clarification of theoretical (4-hour) and practical components of the course
- ⚠️ Stronger link between training and risk-prevention obligations
- 🧷 Visual blocks summarising “Certified – Theoretical – Practical” pillars

**Behind the scenes:** 🏗️  
We reviewed the content with ANAPAT to ensure that the wording matches the standards and certification scope.  
The new structure makes it easier to expand future sections about advanced training, refreshers and IPAF collaboration.
