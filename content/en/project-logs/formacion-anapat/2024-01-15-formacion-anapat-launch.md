🚀 We’re proud to present the **Formación ANAPAT** website as the central hub for training operators of *Plataformas Elevadoras Móviles de Personal (PEMP / MEWP)*.

The aim of this first release is to bring together courses, approved training entities, documentation and news in one place, supporting rental companies and end users across Spain.

From the homepage, visitors can immediately understand the focus on MEWP operator training and navigate quickly to courses, entities, documentation or carnet verification.

**Highlights:**
- 🧭 Clear navigation for ANAPAT, Training, Documentation, News and Contact
- 🎯 Focus on operator training for different MEWP types (1a, 1b, 3a, 3b)
- 🔐 Access area for partners and training entities
- 📱 Responsive layout designed to work on desktop, tablet and mobile
- 📩 Contact section with phone, email and office address

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We structured the platform to support a growing catalogue of courses, training partners and documents, while keeping the UX simple for operators and administrators.  
This release lays the technical and content foundations for future features like richer search, dashboards and integrations.
