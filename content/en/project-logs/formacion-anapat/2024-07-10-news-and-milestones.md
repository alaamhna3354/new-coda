📰 To better showcase the work ANAPAT does in training and sector representation, we improved the **Noticias** section of the site.

The news area now highlights key milestones such as ANAPAT training surpassing 10,000 operators, AENOR’s delivery of the certification as a specialised entity, sector studies and participation in safety and technology events. citeturn8search9turn8search1

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We gave structure to an existing set of articles and prepared the template for new posts, making it easier to keep the site fresh.  
The news system supports ongoing communication with members, training entities and end customers.
