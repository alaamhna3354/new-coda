📚 Formación ANAPAT is more than just courses – it also provides **documentation and tools** that support the safe use of MEWPs.

This release improves the **Documentación** section, organising material into guides, manuals and templates so companies can quickly access the resources they need for training and daily operations. citeturn8search0turn8search7

**Highlights:**
- 📘 Separate sections for Guides, Manuals and Templates
- 🧾 Structured lists of downloadable documents
- 🧩 Space for technical recommendations, inspection checklists and training materials
- 🧭 Clear navigation from training and entity pages to the documentation hub
- 🧑‍💼 Positioning documentation as a complement to certified training

**Behind the scenes:** 🏗️  
We created a content structure that allows ANAPAT to keep adding or updating documents without affecting the overall UX.  
Future iterations can incorporate search and filtering by category, language or document type.
