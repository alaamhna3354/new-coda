🔐 Not all resources are meant for everyone. This release brings **roles, permissions and simple workflows** to Msader.

Admins can now control who can create, edit, publish or archive content. Drafts can be reviewed before going live, and sensitive collections can be limited to specific teams.

**Highlights:**
- 👥 User roles such as Admin, Editor and Viewer
- 🚪 Collection-level permissions to restrict access
- 📝 Draft and published states for resources
- ✅ Simple review flow before publishing key documents
- 🧾 Activity overview showing recent edits and updates

**Behind the scenes:** 🏗️  
We extended the data model to track ownership and state for each resource, making it possible to audit changes later.  
These foundations will also support more advanced approval workflows if needed in future.
