📊 To help the team understand how Msader is used, we introduced **usage analytics and insights**.

Admins can now see which resources are viewed or downloaded most often, which collections are most active and how usage evolves over time. This makes it easier to decide what to improve, update or highlight on the homepage.

**Highlights:**
- 📈 Dashboard with key metrics (views, downloads, active users)
- 🏆 Most popular resources and collections
- 🕒 Time-based charts to see trends over weeks and months
- 🎯 Insights that highlight low-usage areas needing more promotion
- 📤 Export options for sharing reports with stakeholders

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We added lightweight tracking on key actions and a reporting layer that aggregates data without storing any sensitive document content.  
This is the first step towards more advanced reporting, such as per-team engagement and content lifecycle analysis.
