🚀 We’re excited to launch **Msader**, a dedicated knowledge and resources hub.

The goal of this first release is to give teams one place to store and browse all their important documents: policies, procedures, templates, marketing assets and internal guides. Instead of files being scattered across drives and emails, everything now lives in a single, structured platform.

**Highlights:**
- 📚 Central library for documents, guides, media and internal resources
- 🗂️ Collections and categories to group content by team, topic or project
- 🔍 Basic search by title and description
- 📱 Responsive interface that works on desktop and mobile
- 🔐 Private access controlled via login

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We worked with the client to understand the types of content they use daily and designed a flexible content model that can grow over time.  
This release focuses on clarity and stability, providing a solid base for advanced search, permissions and analytics in future iterations.
