🔍 As the number of resources in Msader grows, powerful search becomes critical.

This update introduces **advanced search and filtering**, allowing users to narrow down results by collection, tag, file type and publish date. We also added sorting options so they can jump to the most recent or most relevant documents first.

**Highlights:**
- 🔎 Full-text search across titles, descriptions and metadata
- 🧱 Filters for collection, category, tag and file type
- ⏱️ Sort by newest, oldest or alphabetical order
- 📅 Optional date range filter for time-sensitive documents
- 🧭 Clear search results layout with key metadata at a glance

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We optimised how content is indexed under the hood so searches remain fast, even as the library grows.  
The search UI is designed as a reusable component that can later power search boxes in specific sections or embedded widgets.
