🗂️ In this release we focused on **structure**: how content is grouped, labelled and displayed in Msader.

We introduced collections, categories and tags so that each resource can live in a clear context. Whether users are browsing by department, topic or file type, it’s now much easier to explore the library and keep it organised as it grows.

**Highlights:**
- 🧩 Collections for grouping resources by team, product or initiative
- 🏷️ Tags for marking topics, technologies or document types
- 📁 Category navigation in the sidebar for quick access
- 🔗 Related resources block to suggest similar content
- 🧱 Consistent card layout for all resource listings

**Behind the scenes:** 🏗️  
We redesigned the data model to support multiple ways of categorising the same item without duplication.  
This makes it easier to keep content tidy while still allowing flexible browsing for different audiences.
