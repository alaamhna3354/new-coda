🧾 In this release we focused on making the **menu** easier to understand at a glance.

We introduced clear sections for cold and hot mezze, grilled specialities, vegetarian and vegan dishes, main courses, desserts and drinks. Even without listing every single dish, visitors now get a strong sense of what Damaskus Restaurant Ravensburg offers.

**Highlights:**
- 🥗 Cold mezze overview (hummus, baba ghanoush, salads and more)
- 🍲 Hot mezze and small plates for sharing
- 🔥 Grilled meats and mixed platters as centrepieces of the menu
- 🌿 Vegetarian and vegan-friendly options clearly highlighted
- 🍮 Desserts and hot drinks to round off the evening

**Behind the scenes:** 🏗️  
We structured the content so the team can later plug in full menu details, prices and seasonal specials without changing the layout.  
The menu section is designed to work as a teaser on the landing page and as a base for a future dedicated menu page.
