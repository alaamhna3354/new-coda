⭐ Word of mouth is one of the strongest drivers for restaurant bookings.

In this update we added a **reviews and social proof** section to the landing page. New visitors can now see what other guests say about Damaskus Restaurant Ravensburg and quickly jump to map and review platforms.

**Highlights:**
- 💬 Short quotes from guest reviews highlighting food, service and atmosphere
- ⭐ Visual emphasis on high average ratings
- 🗺️ Link to map / directions for navigation apps
- 📲 Icons and links to social channels (where available)
- 🎯 Stronger trust signals for first-time visitors

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We created a flexible testimonial component where the restaurant can rotate or update quotes over time.  
This section is designed to grow with more reviews and user-generated photos in the future.
