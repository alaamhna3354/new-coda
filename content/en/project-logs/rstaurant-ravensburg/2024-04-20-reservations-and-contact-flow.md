📞 A great restaurant experience often starts with a smooth reservation.

This update refines the **contact and reservation flow** so guests can easily book a table, ask about group events or clarify dietary needs.

**Highlights:**
- 📞 Prominent call-to-action to reserve by phone
- ✉️ Email contact link for inquiries and group reservations
- 📍 Embedded map and full address for easier navigation to the restaurant
- 🕒 Opening hours placed close to the contact section for quick reference
- 🧭 Consistent contact information in both the header and footer

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We optimised the layout for mobile users, who often look for “call” and “directions” buttons while on the move.  
The contact section is flexible enough to integrate a simple reservation form or third-party booking widget in future.
