🍽️ We’re excited to launch the new **Damaskus Restaurant Ravensburg** landing page, giving guests a warm first impression before they even step through the door.

The goal of this first version is simple: present the restaurant’s authentic Syrian and Middle Eastern cuisine, show the cosy atmosphere and make it easy for visitors to find the address, opening hours and contact options.

**Highlights:**
- 🧭 Hero section with restaurant name, short tagline and clear call-to-action
- 📸 Food and interior photography to convey the atmosphere
- 🕒 Opening hours and address visible without scrolling too far
- 📞 Click-to-call and mail links for quick reservations and questions
- 📱 Responsive layout optimised for mobile visitors searching on the go

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We worked with the restaurant to condense their story and offer into a single-page experience that loads fast and answers the main questions: *What food do you serve? Where are you? How can I reserve?*  
This release sets the foundation for future sections such as a full menu, events and customer reviews.
