🕌 Food always tastes better when you know the story behind it.

This release adds more **storytelling and atmosphere** to the landing page: the Syrian roots of the cuisine, the family-style hospitality and the welcoming dining room that Damaskus Restaurant Ravensburg offers.

We also highlight that the restaurant can host small celebrations, birthdays or company dinners on request.

**Highlights:**
- 🧑‍🍳 Short “Our Story” section about the team and their background
- 🕯️ Description of the cosy, warm interior and relaxed atmosphere
- 🎉 Mention of private events and group bookings
- 📸 Additional photos showcasing both food and ambience
- 💬 Copy that invites guests to “experience Syria in Ravensburg”

**Behind the scenes:** 🏗️  
We worked with the restaurant to capture their voice and values in a few concise paragraphs, avoiding long blocks of text.  
The section is designed so it can later be expanded into a full “About us” page if needed.
