🌆 Tilde Madrid is not only about classroom learning – it’s also about **living Madrid in Spanish**.

This update gives more visibility to cultural immersion activities such as walks and cultural visits, coffee and press sessions, lunch with the teacher and weekend excursions. These programmes help students practise Spanish in real contexts while discovering the city.

**Highlights:**
- 🚶 Walks and cultural visits through key neighbourhoods and museums
- ☕ “Café y prensa” sessions combining Spanish news and conversation
- 🍽️ Lunch with the teacher for informal practice in real-life settings
- 🧳 Weekend excursions to explore Madrid and surroundings
- 🎯 Messaging that connects cultural immersion with faster language progress

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We created a dedicated cultural immersion section that can be linked from the homepage and course pages.  
The activities are now described with clear benefits so students understand why they complement classroom learning.
