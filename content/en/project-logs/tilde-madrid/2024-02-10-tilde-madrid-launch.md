🎓 We’re excited to roll out the refreshed website for **Tilde Madrid**, a Spanish school designed specifically for adults in the very centre of Madrid.

The goal of this release is to clearly communicate who the school is for – adults and professionals – and what makes it different: small groups, personalised attention and a strong focus on cultural immersion alongside language learning.

From the hero section, visitors can quickly see core facts such as *20+ years of experience*, *100% native teachers* and *2–4 students per group*.

**Highlights:**
- 🧭 Clear positioning as “Spanish for adults” in the heart of Madrid’s cultural centre
- 📊 Trust indicators: years of experience, native teachers and small class sizes
- 📱 Responsive layout with updated visuals and typography
- 🧑‍🏫 Calls-to-action to *Meet our school* and *View courses*
- 🌍 Multilingual navigation (ES, EN, FR, DE) to support international students

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We reorganised the homepage to balance marketing messages with practical information (who we teach, where we are, how we work).  
The new structure is designed to scale as courses, testimonials and resources grow over time.
