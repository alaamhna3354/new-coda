⭐ Trust is key when choosing a school abroad. This update puts **student testimonials and location** at the centre.

We refined the testimonials section to highlight real stories from students coming from different countries and age groups, and reinforced the message that the school is located in the very cultural centre of Madrid, close to major attractions and cultural spots.

**Highlights:**
- 💬 Curated student testimonials with names, countries and dates
- 🌍 Social proof showing repeat students and long-term relationships
- 📍 Emphasis on the school’s address in the cultural heart of Madrid
- 🧭 Footer section with contact details, map reference and quick links
- 🎯 Stronger narrative around community, atmosphere and teaching quality

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We restructured the testimonial carousel and location block so they can be reused across different pages (home, courses, about).  
This helps new visitors quickly understand why many students return to Tilde Madrid year after year.
