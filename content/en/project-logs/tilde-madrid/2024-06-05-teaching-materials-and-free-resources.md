📘 In this release we highlighted the **teaching materials and free resources** that make Tilde Madrid stand out.

The site now gives more visibility to La Gramática Lola, Spanish for Doctors materials, the Spanish Forum and YouTube video lessons, as well as the online Spanish level test that helps new students find the right group.

**Highlights:**
- 📗 Promotion of *La Gramática Lola* as an in-house grammar book
- 🩺 Materials for Spanish for Doctors and other specialised contexts
- 🎥 Section linking to free video lessons on external platforms
- 🧪 Online Spanish level test with a clear call-to-action
- 📚 Teaching materials integrated into the overall learning journey

**Behind the scenes:** 🏗️  
We connected resource pages with the main course flows so students can move seamlessly from discovering materials to enrolling in a programme.  
The site is now positioned not only as a school, but also as a source of ongoing content for learners.
