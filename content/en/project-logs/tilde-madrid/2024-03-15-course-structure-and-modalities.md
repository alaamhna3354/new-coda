📚 This release focuses on making the **course catalogue** of Tilde Madrid easier to understand and explore.

We reorganised the offer into four clear blocks: General Courses, Spanish for Specific Purposes, Spanish Online and Cultural Immersion. Within each block, visitors can discover the most popular options such as group courses, individual lessons, medical Spanish, Spanish at work, DELE preparation and Spanish & Art.

**Highlights:**
- 🧩 Grouping of courses into General, Specific Purposes, Online and Cultural Immersion
- 👥 Dedicated entries for group courses and individual classes
- 🩺 Specialised tracks like Medical Spanish, Business Spanish and DELE preparation
- 🎨 Spanish & Art and cultural activities featured as part of the learning experience
- 🧭 Navigation that lets visitors move smoothly between course types

**Behind the scenes:** 🏗️  
We worked with the client to clarify target audiences for each course type (beginners, professionals, exam candidates, art lovers).  
The result is a structure that is easier to maintain and extend as new programmes are added.
