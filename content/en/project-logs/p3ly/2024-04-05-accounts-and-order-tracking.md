👤 Returning customers are at the heart of any successful online store.

This update improves the **account experience** on P3LY, clarifying the advantages of creating an account and making sign in and sign up flows smoother and more intuitive.

Customers are reminded that with an account they can track their orders, save multiple shipping addresses and enjoy faster checkout for future purchases.

**Highlights:**
- 🔐 Streamlined sign up and sign in pages with clear calls-to-action
- 🧾 Copy explaining the benefits of having an account (order history, tracking, saved addresses)
- 🔁 Persistent links to “Sign Up”, “Sign In” and “Track Order” from the header
- 📦 Order tracking entry point so users can quickly check their delivery status
- 📧 Easier recovery flows through “Forgot Password”

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We aligned the front-end flows with the existing backend logic for customers, carts and orders, ensuring that account features are consistent across the store.  
The new UX also makes it easier to promote loyalty-oriented features and future account perks.
