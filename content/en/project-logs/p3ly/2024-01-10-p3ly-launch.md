🚀 We’re excited to launch **P3LY Kuwait**, a multi-category online store that brings a wide range of products together in one place for customers across Kuwait.

From the homepage, shoppers can browse toys, electronics, beauty and personal care items, home and kitchen products, baby products, fashion, shoes, mobiles and accessories – all within a single, consistent shopping experience.

P3LY is designed to make online shopping simple, fast and trustworthy, backed by a local presence in Kuwait City.

**Highlights:**
- 🛍️ Multi-category marketplace covering fashion, electronics, home, beauty, toys and more
- 📱 Responsive design that works smoothly on mobile and desktop
- 🧭 Clear top navigation with categories and subcategories for quick discovery
- 🚚 Free shipping on orders above a defined threshold (e.g. 100 KWD, configurable)
- 📞 Local contact details and support for customers in Kuwait

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We worked with the client to define the initial category structure, product data model and content blocks for the homepage.  
This first release focuses on clarity and reliability, creating a foundation that can scale as new categories and campaigns are added.
