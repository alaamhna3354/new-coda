🧭 As the catalogue grows, good navigation becomes essential.

In this release we refined the **category tree and navigation** to reflect how customers actually shop on P3LY. Main categories like Toys, Electronics & Electrical, Beauty and Personal Care, Home & Kitchen, Baby Products, Fashion, Shoes, Mobiles, Mobile Accessories and Medical Equipment & Beauty each now have clear subcategories.

Shoppers can drill down quickly into items like kids’ games, building games, personal care, furniture, children’s shoes, iPhone devices, chargers and more.

**Highlights:**
- 🧸 Expanded Toys section with subcategories for game types and age ranges
- 💡 Electronics & Electrical split into appliances, computer accessories, televisions, gaming and more
- 💄 Beauty & Personal Care broken down into skin, hair, perfumes, men’s care and health products
- 🏠 Home & Kitchen refined into appliances, furniture, storage, décor and kitchenware
- 👶 Dedicated Baby Products, Fashion, Shoes and Mobile categories for faster product discovery

**Behind the scenes:** 🏗️  
We mapped the client’s existing product catalogue into a cleaner taxonomy and updated the navigation components accordingly.  
The new structure keeps things flexible, so future categories can be added without redesigning the entire menu.
