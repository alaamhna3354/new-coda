🔒 Trust is fundamental for any e-commerce experience, especially in a multi-category marketplace.

This update focuses on making P3LY’s **policies and support channels** more visible and easier to understand. Visitors can now quickly access information about returns and refunds, privacy, shipping and delivery, and terms and conditions, as well as direct contact details.

We also set up clearer newsletter sign-up messaging so customers can opt in to hear about new products and offers.

**Highlights:**
- 📜 Footer links for FAQ, About Us, Return and Refund Policy, Privacy Policy, Shipping and Delivery, Terms and Conditions
- 📞 Prominent display of address, phone number and email for support
- 📨 Newsletter sign-up block explaining the benefits of subscribing
- 🧭 Consistent policy layout that is easy to scan on mobile
- 🧱 Content structure ready for localisation and future policy updates

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We normalised policy content into reusable templates so updates can be made safely without affecting the rest of the site.  
With this release, P3LY reinforces its positioning as a serious, trustworthy online store serving customers in Kuwait.
