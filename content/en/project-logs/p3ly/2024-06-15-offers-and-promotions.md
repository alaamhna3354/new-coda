💸 Deals and special offers are a key driver of engagement on P3LY.

This release introduces a dedicated **Offers / Special Offers** experience, along with promotional sections across the site to showcase discounts, bundles and time-limited campaigns.

Customers can now quickly jump into curated lists of discounted items across toys, electronics, beauty, home, fashion and more.

**Highlights:**
- 🏷️ Dedicated Offers page listing discounted and promotional products
- 🎯 Hero banners and promotional tiles to highlight key campaigns on the homepage
- 🧩 Hooks for category-level offers (e.g. toys deals, beauty promos, seasonal campaigns)
- ⏱️ Copy and structure prepared for flash sales or limited-time offers
- 🧭 Links to Offers integrated in the main navigation and footer

**Behind the scenes:** 🏗️  
We configured the content and layout for offers so that the merchandising team can easily plug in future campaigns without development work.  
The structure is flexible enough to support coupon-based discounts, seasonal sales and vendor-specific promotions.
