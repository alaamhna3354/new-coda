📖 To support students beyond the classroom, we turned the **Blog** into a genuine learning companion.

The academy now publishes articles on how to study Arabic effectively, stay motivated, understand different dialects and explore Arab culture.

This release organises these posts into a simple, easy‑to‑browse layout and connects them with key course and service pages.

**Highlights:**
- 📰 Blog listing with clear titles, excerpts and “Read more” links
- 🎓 Articles that answer common questions and support self‑study
- 🔗 Cross‑links between posts and relevant courses to guide readers
- 📅 Space for ongoing content publishing and SEO growth
- 🧑‍🎓 A helpful, encouraging tone focused on empowering learners

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We treated the blog as both a marketing asset and a pedagogical tool.  
The layout makes it easy for the team to keep publishing, while internal linking helps the site build authority around Arabic learning and cultural topics.
