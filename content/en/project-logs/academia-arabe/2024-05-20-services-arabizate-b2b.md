🌐 Academia Árabe is not only a language school; it is also a strategic partner for organisations that need to communicate with Arabic‑speaking audiences.

This release introduces a **Services** area that explains how the academy supports companies, institutions and media through Arabization, cultural consulting, research, exam creation, translation and digital content.

Each service has its own page with a clear description, who it is for and what problems it solves.

**Highlights:**
- 🌍 Landing pages for services such as Arabízate, cultural advisory, research and exam creation
- 🧾 Clear value propositions for businesses, universities and public institutions
- 🧠 Emphasis on deep expertise in Arabic language and culture
- 🧩 Reusable layout so new services can be launched easily
- 📩 Calls‑to‑action inviting organisations to request tailored proposals

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We worked hand‑in‑hand with the client to extract years of experience into a small set of clear, understandable services.  
The new structure positions Academia Árabe as a long‑term partner for organisations working with the Arab world.
