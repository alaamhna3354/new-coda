⭐ Learning a language takes time and commitment, so trust is essential.

This update brings **social proof** to the foreground by showcasing testimonials from students and logos of organisations that have worked with Academia Árabe.

Visitors can now see that the academy combines academic quality with practical results for real people and real brands.

**Highlights:**
- 💬 Testimonial section with quotes from students about their progress
- 🏢 Grid of client logos showing companies and institutions that trust the academy
- 🎯 Messaging focused on teaching quality, methodology and support
- 🎓 Strong link between academic rigour and real‑life outcomes
- 📈 Trust blocks reused across the homepage, courses and services pages

**Behind the scenes:** 🏗️  
We consolidated scattered feedback and references into a single, reusable component.  
As new testimonials and clients are added, the academy’s credibility will continue to grow without redesigning the site.
