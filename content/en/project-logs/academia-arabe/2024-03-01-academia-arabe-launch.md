🎓 We’re excited to launch the renewed website for **Academia Árabe**, a reference academy for learning Arabic in Spain.

The goal of this release is to present everything the academy offers – in‑person classes in Madrid, live online lessons and flexible hybrid programmes – in a single, clear and modern experience.

From the first screen, visitors understand what the academy does, who it helps and how they can start learning Arabic in the way that best fits their lifestyle.

**Highlights:**
- 🧭 Clear hero section explaining the academy’s mission and methodology
- 📚 Overview of in‑person, online and hybrid learning formats
- 🧑‍🏫 Emphasis on native, qualified teachers and communicative approach
- 📱 Fully responsive layout for desktop, tablet and mobile
- 🔗 Intuitive navigation that connects Courses, Services, About and Blog

**Behind the scenes:** 🛠️  
We restructured the information architecture so prospective students can quickly find the right option for them (general Arabic, dialect, intensive courses, corporate training and more).  
This release lays the foundation for future localisation and more detailed course pages.
