📚 This release focuses on turning the course offering into a **structured, easy‑to‑scan catalogue**.

We organised programmes into three main modalities – in‑person, online and hybrid – and highlighted popular formats such as group courses, intensive programmes, dialect courses and private classes.

Each course card now communicates the essentials at a glance: modality, level, approximate duration and learning focus.

**Highlights:**
- 🧩 Categorisation of courses by modality (in‑person, online, hybrid)
- 🎯 Clear cards for general Arabic, dialect courses, intensives and corporate training
- ⏱️ Basic information about duration, frequency and level
- 🧭 Entry points that lead to more detailed course descriptions
- 🌍 Copy written for Spanish‑speaking students with practical goals

**Behind the scenes:** 🏗️  
We refactored the course data model so the team can add new programmes or update existing ones without touching the layout.  
This sets up the site for future filters (by level, modality or goal) and better SEO around Arabic learning in Spain.
