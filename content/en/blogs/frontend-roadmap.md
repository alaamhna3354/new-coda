# Your Modern Frontend Roadmap

Frontend development is one of the most popular and accessible paths into web development.  
The problem: **there are too many tools and too many tutorials.**

This roadmap focuses on *what actually matters* so you can ship real projects and build a portfolio, not just collect bookmarks.

---

## 1. Foundations: HTML & CSS

Before touching any framework, make sure you are comfortable with:

- **HTML**
  - Semantic tags (`header`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `nav`…)
  - Forms, inputs, labels, accessibility basics
- **CSS**
  - Box model, display, position
  - Flexbox & CSS Grid
  - Responsive design (mobile-first)
  - Basic animations & transitions

> Goal: you should be able to build a clean, responsive landing page from a Figma design.

A good practice project here:

- Personal landing page
- Simple product page
- Blog homepage with cards

---

## 2. Modern JavaScript

Next step: understand JavaScript as a language, not only as "something for frameworks".

Focus on:

- Variables, scope, `let` / `const`
- Functions, arrow functions
- Arrays & objects
- `map`, `filter`, `reduce`
- Async JS (`Promise`, `async/await`)
- Modules (`import` / `export`)

Once you can:

- Fetch data from an API
- Render it on the page
- Handle loading & error states

…you’re ready to move to frameworks.

---

## 3. A main framework: Vue + Nuxt (recommended)

You don’t need to learn all frameworks. Pick **one** and go deep.

If you’re already in the Nuxt ecosystem, a great stack is:

- **Vue 3 (Composition API)**
- **Nuxt 3** for full apps (routing, SSR, SEO, etc.)
- **Nuxt UI** for ready-made components
- **Nuxt Content** for blogs and docs

Key concepts to learn:

- Components & props
- `ref` / `reactive`
- Computed properties
- Lifecycle hooks
- Routing & dynamic routes
- Data fetching with `useAsyncData` / `useFetch`

Practice project ideas:

- Blog with Nuxt Content
- Dashboard with charts
- Small SaaS-style landing page with auth (even fake auth)

---

## 4. Styling at scale: Tailwind & design systems

For modern frontend work, you’ll often see:

- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- A design system / component library (like **Nuxt UI**)

Learn how to:

- Use Tailwind’s spacing, colors, typography
- Customize your theme (primary color, border radius, etc.)
- Create consistent components: buttons, cards, inputs, layouts

A nice exercise:

- Recreate a Dribbble shot or popular landing page using Nuxt + Tailwind + Nuxt UI.

---

## 5. Tooling & best practices

To be ready for real-world work, get comfortable with:

- Git & GitHub (branches, PRs, basic CI)
- ESLint & Prettier
- Environment variables
- Basic performance tips (images, lazy loading, code splitting)

You don’t need to become a DevOps engineer, but you *do* need to comfortably:

- Run `npm run build`
- Fix build errors
- Deploy to services like Vercel / Netlify

---

## 6. Building a portfolio that gets you interviews

Instead of 100 half-finished tutorials, aim for **3–5 polished projects**:

1. **Personal site** – who you are, what you do, links to your work.
2. **Real-world UI clone** – clone a known website (landing page, dashboard).
3. **Data-driven app** – something using a public API (movies, weather, crypto…).
4. *(Bonus)* A small product or open-source contribution.

Make sure each project:

- Is deployed and shareable with one link
- Has a short description: what you built, what tech you used
- Looks good on mobile

---

## 7. A suggested path (in weeks)

Of course, timing depends on your schedule, but as a rough idea:

- **Weeks 1–3**: HTML + CSS + responsive layouts
- **Weeks 4–6**: Core JavaScript + DOM + APIs
- **Weeks 7–10**: Vue 3 + Nuxt 3 basics
- **Weeks 11–14**: Tailwind + Nuxt UI + Nuxt Content
- **Weeks 15+**: Portfolio, polishing, and job preparation

---

## Final words

Frontend is a huge space, but your path doesn’t need to be confusing.

1. **Strong basics** (HTML, CSS, JS)  
2. **One framework** (Vue/Nuxt)  
3. **Real projects** that solve real problems  

If you follow this roadmap and keep shipping small things, you’ll be ahead of most beginners who stay stuck jumping between tutorials.
