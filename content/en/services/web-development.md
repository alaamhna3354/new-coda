## Modern websites built for your business

Your website is often the **first interaction** people have with your brand.  
We build fast, responsive and scalable websites that not only look good, but also support your real business goals — whether that’s leads, bookings, sales or simply trust.

From simple landing pages to complete web applications, we tailor the solution to your needs.

## What we build

- Marketing websites and landing pages  
- Corporate and portfolio sites  
- Web applications and dashboards  
- E-commerce and booking flows (where needed)  
- Multi-language websites ready for international users  

We focus on clean structure, performance and a content setup that your team can maintain over time.

## Our web development process

### 1. Discovery & scope

We start by understanding:

- Your business, audience and offer  
- What the website should actually achieve (contacts, sales, signups…)  
- What content you already have and what needs to be created  
- Any technical constraints (hosting, existing systems, deadlines)

This gives us a clear scope instead of a vague “build a website”.

### 2. Structure & sitemap

Next, we define the **architecture of the site**:

- Sitemap (pages and their relationships)  
- Navigation and header/footer structure  
- Key sections on the homepage and important subpages  

The goal is to make it easy for users to find what they need in just a few clicks.

### 3. UI/UX & components

We design a simple, consistent interface:

- Layouts for homepage and core pages  
- Reusable components (hero sections, feature blocks, cards, forms, FAQs…)  
- Responsive behaviour across desktop, tablet and mobile  

This step ensures we have a solid design system instead of random pages.

### 4. Development & integrations

We then implement the website using **modern web technologies**:

- Clean, maintainable front-end code  
- CMS or content layer (if needed) so you can edit content without coding  
- Integrations (contact forms, analytics, emails, third-party tools)  
- Basic SEO structure (meta tags, headings, open graph, sitemaps…)

We keep performance and scalability in mind from the beginning.

### 5. Testing & launch

Before going live we:

- Test on different screen sizes and major browsers  
- Check core flows (forms, navigation, CTAs)  
- Optimise for loading speed where possible  

Then we help you deploy the site and verify everything works in production.

### 6. Support & evolution

A good website is never really “finished”. We can:

- Add new pages and sections as your business grows  
- Improve existing content and calls-to-action  
- Analyse traffic and behaviour to refine the experience  

You get a foundation that can evolve, not a rigid site that you’re afraid to touch.

## What you get

- A responsive, modern website aligned with your brand  
- Clear structure and navigation for your users  
- A scalable setup that can grow with new features and content  
- A technical stack that your team (or any future team) can maintain  
- A web presence that feels **professional, fast and trustworthy**
