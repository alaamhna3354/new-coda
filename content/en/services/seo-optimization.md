## SEO that fits your business

Good SEO is not about tricks – it’s about **helping the right people find you** at the right moment.  
We optimise your website so it can rank higher on search engines, attract qualified visitors and turn them into real customers.

We focus on long-term, stable results instead of short, risky hacks.

## What we do

- **Technical SEO** – making sure your website is fast, crawlable and indexable  
- **On-page SEO** – optimising titles, meta tags, headings, URLs and internal links  
- **Content optimisation** – aligning your pages with the keywords and topics your audience actually searches for  
- **Local SEO** – improving visibility for local searches (e.g. city, area, “near me”)  
- **Performance & UX** – improving speed and structure so users and search engines both love your site

## Our SEO process

### 1. SEO audit

We start with a **complete SEO health check**:

- How search engines currently see your website  
- Crawl and indexing issues  
- Speed and Core Web Vitals  
- Structure of pages, headings and internal links

You get a clear picture of where you are now.

### 2. Keyword & competitor research

Next, we identify **what your audience is searching for**:

- Main keywords for your services and products  
- Long-tail keywords with high intent  
- Competitors who already rank and what they are doing

We use this to define a realistic strategy: where to start and what to focus on.

### 3. On-page optimisation

We optimise your key pages so they speak clearly to both **users and search engines**:

- Titles, meta descriptions and headings  
- Clean, readable URLs  
- Internal linking between related pages  
- Content structure that answers user questions

We keep your brand voice while making the pages more search-friendly.

### 4. Content & structure

SEO needs content to work. We help you:

- Decide which pages you need (services, locations, FAQs, blog…)  
- Improve existing content so it matches search intent  
- Plan new content that can bring the right traffic over time

The goal is to build a site structure that **makes sense to humans and to Google**.

### 5. Technical fixes

We handle or document the main technical issues:

- Indexing and sitemap configuration  
- Robots and canonical URLs  
- Speed optimisations (where possible on the front-end side)  
- Fixing broken links and basic errors

For deeper platform-level or server-level changes, we can coordinate with your internal team.

### 6. Monitoring & iteration

SEO is not “set and forget”. We:

- Track rankings for key keywords  
- Monitor organic traffic and behaviour on key pages  
- Adjust content and internal linking as needed

You stay informed about what is improving and where we still have work to do.

## What you get

- Clear SEO audit and priority list of issues  
- Optimised key pages for your main services or products  
- Keyword strategy focused on real opportunities  
- Better structure and content plan for future growth  
- Ongoing recommendations you can follow with or without us

SEO Optimization helps your website become a **reliable source of organic traffic**, not just a static online brochure.
