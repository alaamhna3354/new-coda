## Project Analysis

Before writing a single line of code, we make sure your idea is **clear, realistic and technically solid**.  
Our Project Analysis service helps you transform a rough idea into a well-defined, executable plan.

We analyse the business goals, users, technical requirements and constraints so the project starts with **clarity instead of guesses**.

## What we do

- Clarify the project vision and main objectives  
- Understand your target users and their real needs  
- Define the core features for the first release (MVP)  
- Identify risks, dependencies and technical challenges  
- Estimate effort and recommend a realistic roadmap

The result is a project that is **aligned with your goals**, not just a list of random features.

## Our process

### 1. Discovery workshop

We start with a structured conversation about your project:

- What problem are we solving?
- Who are the users?
- What does success look like for you?
- What is the expected timeline and budget?

We gather all existing materials: ideas, notes, examples, references and current tools you use.

### 2. Requirements & use cases

Next, we translate your ideas into **clear requirements**:

- User stories and main use cases  
- Functional requirements (what the system should do)  
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability…)  
- Integrations with other systems and tools

We prioritise together what must be in the **first version** and what can come later.

### 3. Technical analysis & architecture (high level)

We then propose a **technical approach** that fits your project:

- Recommended technologies and frameworks  
- High-level system architecture  
- Data and API structure (conceptual)  
- Third-party services (payments, auth, storage, emails, analytics…)

The goal is not to over-complicate things, but to choose a stack that is **stable, maintainable and future-proof**.

### 4. Risks, constraints & assumptions

Every project has constraints. We identify them early:

- Technical risks (complex features, performance, integrations)  
- Business risks (dependencies on partners, unclear responsibilities)  
- Legal or compliance aspects if relevant (data, privacy…)

We also make explicit the **assumptions** we are making so nothing stays “implicit” or vague.

### 5. Roadmap & estimation

Finally, we propose a **phased roadmap**:

- Clear phases (MVP, improvements, advanced features)  
- Rough effort estimation per phase  
- Suggestions for what to launch first to validate the idea quickly

You end up with a project that can be **planned and executed**, not just imagined.

## Deliverables

At the end of Project Analysis, you can expect:

- A written summary of goals, users and main use cases  
- A structured list of features, with priorities  
- A high-level technical proposal and architecture overview  
- Identified risks and recommendations  
- A proposed roadmap for the next steps

You can use these deliverables to continue working with us or to share with your internal team or other partners.

## Who is this for?

- Startups that need to validate their idea before investing heavily  
- Companies that want to rebuild or modernise an existing system  
- Teams that feel “stuck” with a vague scope and need clarity  
- Business owners who want a **technical partner**, not just coders

Good project analysis saves **time, money and frustration** later in development.
