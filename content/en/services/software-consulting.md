## Turning business challenges into software solutions

Software should **work for you**, not the other way around.  
With our Software Consulting service, we analyse your processes and systems, then design practical software solutions and automations that remove friction and save time.

Whether you want to improve an existing system or design something new from scratch, we help you make the right technical decisions.

## What we do

- Analyse your current workflows and tools  
- Identify bottlenecks and manual steps that can be automated  
- Recommend the right technologies and platforms for your context  
- Design technical architectures that are scalable and maintainable  
- Help you choose between custom development, ready-made tools or a hybrid approach

Our goal is not to push a specific technology, but to choose what **really fits your business**.

## Typical consulting topics

- Should we rebuild our system or integrate with what we already have?  
- How do we connect different tools (CRM, ERP, website, mobile app) together?  
- Which parts are worth automating first for the biggest impact?  
- How do we structure our data so we can actually use it later (reports, dashboards)?  
- What is a realistic roadmap for the next 3–6–12 months?

## Our approach

### 1. Understanding your business

We start by understanding:

- What you do and how you work today  
- Which tools and systems you already use  
- Where your team loses the most time or makes avoidable mistakes  
- What “success” would look like after improvement

This is not about technology first – it’s about your **operations and priorities**.

### 2. Mapping processes and pain points

We map your key processes step by step:

- Sales, onboarding, project delivery, support, reporting…  
- Manual data entry, repetitive tasks, copy-paste between systems  
- Double work, delays and frequent errors

From there we highlight the opportunities for automation and simplification.

### 3. Technical options & architecture

Then we evaluate **how** to solve the problems:

- What can be achieved with your current tools  
- Where it makes sense to build custom software  
- How to connect systems via APIs or integrations  
- High-level architecture diagrams that explain the proposed setup

You get a clear view of the trade-offs between different options (cost, time, flexibility).

### 4. Action plan & roadmap

We turn the analysis into a **concrete plan**:

- Which improvements to start with (quick wins)  
- Which projects need more time and budget  
- Suggested phases with priorities and dependencies  
- Recommendations on team structure (internal, external, hybrid)

You can execute this roadmap with us or with your own team.

### 5. Implementation support (optional)

If you wish, we can:

- Work with your developers as an external technical partner  
- Help you review code, architecture and technical decisions  
- Validate deliveries against the original objectives  
- Adjust the roadmap based on what we learn along the way

## What you gain

- Clarity on what to build, improve or retire  
- A realistic plan instead of scattered ideas  
- Less manual work and fewer repetitive tasks for your team  
- Better use of the tools and data you already have  
- A software ecosystem that can **grow with your business**, not block it

Software Consulting is ideal if you **feel the pain** in your operations, but you’re not sure what the exact solution should be yet.
